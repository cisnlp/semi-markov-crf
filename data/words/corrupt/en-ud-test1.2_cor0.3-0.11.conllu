is
givingaway
8
5
%
of

,
mostly
to
theBill
andMelinda
Gates
F

on
.

It
's
a
movethat
re
ally
worriesme
;
Buffett
'susual
justificat
ion
for
keep
ing
most
ofhis
m
oney
was
that
hewas
still
compounding
the
valueof
his
fortune
at
a
prettyhigh
rat
e
,so
anygifts
nowwould
mea
n
si
gnificantly
lessmoney
for

.

It
's
a
littl
e
hard
to
parse
,
bu
t
atthis
pointhis
ostensible
view
isthat
the
Gateses
are
very
good
money
-
redistri
butors
,and
he
wants
them
to

.

Which
essen
tially
sounds
likehe
's
worried
that
Bill
orMelinda
aregoing
to

s
oon
.

I
assume
his
actual
reasonis
th
at
he
'sworried
that
Berkshir

Hathawayjust
ca
n't
g
row
quickl
y
enough
tojustify
his
usualcharity

.

I
'm
notsure
howthe

ct
.

Itdoes

the

ompany

and
asthe
articlenotes
,the

Onthe

this
isessentially
a
st
atement
thatthe

overpricedfrom
theguy
who

happe

em
...no
...the
Gatesfoundation
mainly
in
vests

educatio
n
,
that
means
donating
now
adds
atremendous
value
compared
to
donating
in
ten
years
.

Because

i

He

)
.

He

entions

It
sounds
pretty
ratio
nal
that
he
'ssaying
thatBill

at
a
prime
spot
,
so
startingthe

is
a

that
wouldhave
allowedthe
USto

fromPakistan
.

I
presume
you
need
thePakistan
basefor
resc

ns
in

anything
wentwrong
.

Youalso
need
Pakistani

The

in

1966at

.

B
y
Septe

TheDow
thenrallied
to
a

in

of

.

ByMarch
of
'68
the
Dow
hadfallen
to825
,only
toclimb
toa
highly
specu

peak
of985
in
Decemberof

.

TheDow
th
en
sank
to

in
De

ByApril

the
D

had
climbed
back
to950
,
only
tofall
to
869
in
February
of
'72
.

A
big
rally
then
took
the
Dow
(
unconf
irmed
)
to
a
record
high
of
1051
in
Januaryof

,
turningeveryone

But
by
Decemberof

the

Think
thatwas
bad-
by
December
of'74
the

sunk
to
a

At
