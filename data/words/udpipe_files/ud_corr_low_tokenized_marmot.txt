,
but
out
ofthe
NYTimes
and
Washington
Post
completely
.

Ihad
to
go
to
the
BBC
for
this
report
.

It
's
symptoma
tic
,
I
suppose
,
ofour
fast
-paced
,
24
hour
news
-
cycle
live
s
,
that
the
biggest
short
-
termhumanitarian
crisis
in
the
world
would
quickly
be
eclipse
d
,
once
ourSecretary
of
St
ate
was
finished
withhis
whirlwind
tour
,
fromthe
n
ew
spapers
.

It
's
just
d
isappointing
.

Most
tr
oubli
ng
,
ho
wever
,
is
the
factthat
the
poli
tical
will
to
end
the
crisis
expressed
a
few
short
weeks
ago
se
ems
tohave
ebbed
.

At
that
time
,
UN
Secretary
Gene
ral
KofiAnnan
demanded
steps
be
taken
to
end
the
ethnic
vi
ol
ence
in
Darfur
within48
hours
.

Two
weeks
later
,
and
the
vi
olence
continues
.

The
African
Union
is
clearly
no
t
up
to
the
task
of
keeping
thepeace
,
pledging
300
troops
to
an
ar
ea
that
will
ne
ed
15,000
,
accord
ing
to
analysts
.

And
international
do
no
rs
have
given
o
nly
half
of
the
relief
aid
that
Darfur
needs
,
a
ccord
ing
to
the
local
UN
official
s.

So
hear
we
are
,
two
weeks
l
ater
,
after
that
dazzling
PR
display
two
weeks
a
go
by
Powell
and
An
nan
,
and
the
situati
on
on
the
gro
und
in
Darfur
appears
basicallyunchanged
.

Warren
Buffett
is
giving
awa
y
85
%
of
his
wealt
h
,
mostly
to
the
Billand
MelindaGates
Foundation
.

It
's
a
m
o
ve
tha
t
rea
lly
worries
me
;
Buffett
's
usual
justification
for
kee
ping
most
ofhis
money
was
that
he
was
still
compounding
the
val
ue
of
his
fortune
at
a
pretty
high
rat
e
,
so
any
gifts
now
woul
d
mean
si
gnificantly
less
m
oney
for
the
foundationlater
.

It
's
alittle
hard
to
parse
,
but
at
this
pointhis
ostensible
view
is
thatthe
Gateses
a
re
very
good
money
-
redistributors
,
and
hewants
them
to
have
the
money
as
soon
aspossible
.

Which
essentiallysounds
like
he
's
w
orried
that
Bill
or
Melin
da
ar
e
going
to
die
soon
.

I
assume
his
actualreason
isthat
he
's
worried
that
Berkshire
Hathaway
justca
n't
grow
quickly
enoug
h
to
justifyhis
usualcharity
policy
.

I
'm
not
sure
how
the
market
willreact
.

It
does
n't
change
th
e
company'
sintrinsic
worth
,
and
as
the
article
notes
,
the
company
might
be
added
to
a
major
index
once
the
shares
get
more
liquid
.

On
the
other
hand
,
this
is
essentiallya
statementthat
the
com
pany
isoverpriced
from
t
he
guy
whoknows
it
best
--
and
happens
to
be
the
best
inves
tor
of
the
last
century
.

em
...
no
...
theGates
foundation
mainly
invests
in
medical
rese
arch
and
education
,
that
m
eans
d
onatin
g
now
adds
a
tremendous
value
compar
ed
to
donatingin
ten
years
.

Because
the
10.000.000people
dying
from
malaria
will
otherwise
be
dea
d
.

i.e
.

He
'
s
not
giving
85
%
away
,
he
's
giving
a
numbe
r
of
shares
each
year
that
decreasein
number
at
the
rateof
5
%
a
year
(
until
gone
?
)
.

He
mentions
his
wife
's
deat
h
h
aving
an
effect
o
n
him
.

It
sounds
pretty
rational
that
he
's
say
ing
that
Bill
and
Melinda
are
at
a
pri
me
spot
,
sostarting
themoney
hose
now
is
a
good
idea
,
but
Buf
fet
is
still
keeping
most
of
his
donation
inside
o
f
Berkshire
where
it
willcompound
.

Bill

as

:

On

Syria
,
the
terrorist

Hamas
has
indica
ted
it

participate
in
the

upcoming

.

To
the

Le
banon
,
there
is
serious
debatewithin
Hezbollah
about
enteringthe
Lebanese
political
process
inlight
of
Syria
's

.

Syr

under
the
co

ti
ons
set

in
UNSC
Resolution
1559
,
which

to

"
after

.

This

is
a
cancerous
t
umor
onthe

Over

the

,
despite
their
attempts
to
project
strength
in

still

the
word
"

"
,
wafflingover
the
issue
of
whether
t

are
terrorist
acts
.

The
me
dia
r
outinely
obscur
es
the
l
ines
between
terrorism
and
legitimate
resistance
,
as
the
recent
article
by
DanielOkrent
of
The
NewYork
Times
dem
onstrates
.

...

Thedecision
to
sidestep
the
obviou
s
tosatisfy
the
need
to
avoid
confrontation
does
not
bring
peace
,
but
only
delays
theeventual
conflict
as
the
predators
of
Hamas
an
d
Hezbollah
exploit
the
inherent
weakness
of
the
inte
rnationals
and
the
media
.

I
've
been
fumi
ng
over
thisfact
for
a
few
weeks
now
,
ever
since
some
organizations
and
governments
suggested
weneed
toaccept
th
e
fact
that
H
ezbollah
will
get
involvedin
runnin
g
Lebanon
.

Wt
f
isthis
?

This
is
a
terroristorganization
plain
and
simple
.

This
is
the
o
rg
anization
that
bombed
our
Marine
barracks
in
1
983
,
took
Americans
host
a
ge
throughout
the
80's
and
now
they
should
be
considered
a
legitimate
organizat
ion
?

This
is
just
another
reason
to
never
trust
the
MSM
,
and
certainly
not
the
E
uropeans
.

The
Ir
a
qi
Islamic
Party
lead
by
Muhsin
Abdul
Hamid
,
has
been
among
the
few
Sunni
Musl
im
groups
willing
to
coope
r
ate
(
even
if
rather
lukewarmly
)
with
theAmericans
.

It
is
now
threateningto
pull
o
ut
of
the
Allaw
i
caretaker
government
.

The
IIPhad
also
b
een
the
main
force
urgingSunni
Arabs
to
participate
in
theelections
scheduled
for
January
,
and
had
been
opposedin
t
his
stance
by
theAssociation
of
Muslim
Sch
olars
.

That
the
Iraqi
IslamicParty
isnow
contemplat
ing
leaving
the
Allawi
governmentraises
the
question
of
w
hether
a
mass
Sunni
Arabboycott
of
t
he
elections
isin
the
offing
,
thus
fatally
weakening
the
legitimac
y
o
f
any
new
government
.

Az-
Zaman
:
The
Associat
ion
of
Mu
sli
m
Scholars
forbade
Iraqis
to
participate
in
theattack
on
Falluja
h
with
the
Amer
icans
.

In
a
co
mmunique
,
the
AMS
said
that
for
Iraqis
to
take
part
with
"
rai
ding
forces
"
in
the
assault
on
a
city
,
the
population
of
which
is
Mus
lim
(
such
as
Fallujah
)
would
be
consider
ed
the
mo
st
mortal
ofmortal
sins
.

The
Su
nni
AMS
told
Ir
aqis
,
"
You
sinned
when
you
partic
i
pated
with

forcesin
th
e

and

lest
you
repeat
this
samesin
i

.

Rememberthat
th

"

The
radical
Shiite
Sadr
movement
issueda
statement
forbidding
the
participation
of
I
raqi
troops
in
the
attack
onFallujah
,
as
well
.

The
statement
said
,
"
We

On
the
in
ternet
siteof
Monotheism
and
Holy

(
al

Tawhid
wa
al

Jihad
)
,
the

allegedly
declared
,
"
We
announce
that
the
Tawhid
and

Group
,
its
prince
and
so
ldiers
,
have
pledgedallegiance
to
the
sheikhof
the
mujahideen
Osamabin

.
"

This
pledge
is
a
newdevelopment
.

Abu
Musab

qawi
a
nd
hisgroup
aresaid
to
have
been
bitter
rivals
of
al
-
Qaeda
during
the
Afghan
r
esistance
days
.

One
witness
at
the
Moutasaddiq
trial
in
Germany
allegedthat
Zarqawihad
notallowed
Monotheism
a
nd
Holy
War
to
share
resources
with
al
-
Qaedain
the
early
zeroes
of
the
21st
century
.

If
the
statementis
tr
ue
,
it
is
a
worrying
sign
that
e
ven
the
di
vided
sma
ll
r
adic
al
guerrilla
groups
are
being
"
picked
up
"
by
al
-
Qaeda
.

This
consolidation
is
obviously
a
result
ofBush
's
aggressive
invasion
of
Iraq
and
of
the
botching
of
theaftermath
.

It
is
a
setback
for
the
war
on
terror
.

Al
-
Qaeda
in
Afghanistan
was
a
group
of
only
a
few
hundred
"
Afghan
Arabs
"
who
pledged
perso
nal
loyalty
to
Usamah
Bin
Laden
.

It
could
notionally
be
expandedto
encompass
the
5,000
-
strong
"55th
Brigade
"
of
the
Taliban
regime
,
though
this
is
not
the
technical
definition
.

Because
Usamah
is
Sa
udi
,
my
guess
is
that
the
y
were
especially
influ
enced
by
an
extremist
form
of
theWahhabi
school
of
Islam
that
predominates
among
Saudia
's
so
me
15million
cit
ize
ns
.

In
19
98
they
were
joined
by
E
gyptians
from
the
al
-
Jihad
al
-
Islami
group
of
Ayma
n
al
-Zawahiri
(
many
of
thesewere
from
Upper
Egypt
,
especially
Asyut
and
environs
)
.

Aft
er
thatpoint
,
a
l-Qaeda
was
a
joint
enterprise
between
the
E
gyptian
extremists
a
nd
the
pol
yglo
t
Arabs
around
Bin
Laden
,
only
some
of
whom
were
Saudi
.

Zarqawi
is
a
Jordanian
,
and
his
Monotheism
and
H
o
ly
War
group
in
Afghanistan
probably
had
adistinctive
coloration
as
mainly
Jordanian
,
Palestinian
and
Syrian
.

Theyalso
h
ad
a
special
connection
to
some
e
xtremists
in
Jordan
and
Germany
.

They
are
probably
especially
orien
ted
t
oward
the
Salafi
school
of
mode
rn
Islamic
th
ought
,
which
has
a
Protestant
-
like
emphasis
on
g
oing
bac
k
to
t
he
origin
al
practic
e
of
the
earlycompanions
of
theProphet
Muhammad
.

(
Most
Salafis
are
not
mil
itant
or
violent
,
though
they
tendto
be
rath
er
na
rrow
-
minded
in
my
experience
,
on
the
order
of
P
rotestant
Piet
ists
)
.

Monotheism
and
Holy
War
obvi
ously
does
have
a
vio
lent
interp
retatio
n
of
Salafism
,
rather
asthe
the
leaders
of
the
so-
call
ed
German
PeasantRebellion
among
early
Protestants
did
.

Another
worriso
me
signis
that
local
Iraqi
Sunni
fun
damen
talists
opposed
tothe
US
presence
i
n
Iraq
have
begunjoining
Monotheism

Holy

in

.

Sonow
there
are
hundreds
of
al
-

membersin
Iraq
where
there
had
been
none
before
.

The
consolidation
ofsmaller
local

fund
amentali
st
groups
with
a
l-Q
aeda
can
als
o
be
seen
in
th
e
case
of
the
F
izazi
groupin
Tangiers
that
morphed
intothe
M
oroccan
IslamicCombatant
Group
,
had
members
whomet
with
September

ringleader
Muhammad
Atta
,
and
ultimatelywas
in

responsible
forthe
Madri

.

The
September

Panel
will
issue
its
findings
on
Thursda
y
.

It
notes10
points
at
which
the
US
made
key
mistakesthat
might
have
stopped
Bin

's
plot
.

Four
of
these
were
under
Clint
on
and

u
nder
Bush
.

outtoday

that
if

hadknown
whatwas
coming
,
he
would
haveexpended
every
effort
to
stop
it
,
and
that
so
would
have
Clinton
.

This
s
tateme
nt
is
,
despite
its
fa
cade
of
f
air-mindedness
,
so
many
weasel
words
.

Of
cour
se
Bu
s
h
would
have
tried
to
stop

if
he
had
known
it
was
coming
.

The
que
s
tion
is
,
"
Should
he
have
known
it
was
coming
?
"

The
answer
is
,
"
Yes
!
"

We
now
know
thatBush
and
h
is
administration
came
into
o
ffice
obsessed
with
Iraq
.

Chene
y
was
lookingat

about
opportuniti
es
for

es
there
,
already
in

of

Even

,

.

As
for
the
Clinton
administration
,
let
me
say
one
thing
inits
defens
e.

Clinton
had
worked
out
a
dealwith
Pakistani
Prime
Mini
ste
r
Nawaz
Sharif
in
s
ummer
of
1999
that
wouldhave
allowed
the
US
to
send
a
Special
Opsteam
in
after
B
in
Laden
in
Qandahar
,
based
from
Pakist
an
.

I
presume
you
need
the
Pakis
tan
base
for
rescueoperations
in
cas
e
anything
went
wrong
.

You
also
needPakistani
air
space
.

The
plan
was
all
set
and
could
havesucceeded
.

But
in
fall
of
19
99
,
Gen.
Pervez
Musharraf
made
a
coup
against
N
awaz
Sharif
.

The
Pakistaniarmy
was
rife
withelements
protective
of
th
e
Taliban
,
and
th
e
new
military
government
reneged
on
the
deal
.

Musharra
f
told
Clinton
he
could
n't
use
Pakis
tani
soil
orair
s
pace
to
send
the
team
in
against
Bin
Laden
.

Look
at
a
map
and
you
try
to
figure
out
ho
w
,
in
fall
of
1999
,
youcould
possibly
pull
off
suchan
operation
without
Pakistanifacilities
.

Of
course
,
you
could
just
go
in
by
main
force
.

Butfor
those
of
you
tempted
in
tha
t
direction
,
pleaselook
up
Carter
's
Tabas
operation
.

It
shou
ld
be
easily
googled
.

Clinton
tried
,
and
tried
hard
.

The
gods
were
n't
with
us
on
that
one
.

John
,

Hellofrom
South
Americ
a
.

I
just
got
your
email
andI
certainlyconcur
with
Jeff
making
the
call
.

He
h
a
s
maintained
a
good
relationship
with
Mulva
.

Thiswas
a
risk
thatwe
had
but
we
did
have
assurances
from
Ph
illi
ps
regar
ding
performance
.

I
do
n't
know
how
much
it
will
help
however
.

Richard
Harper
and
Mary
N
ell
Br
owning
may
have
some
ideas
here
but
I
am
sure
you
've
already
gone
through
it
with
them
.

I
am
amazed
how
the
d
etails
get
fuzzy
on
an
old
p
roject
.

When
you
discussed
it
,
iwas
trying
to
thi
nk
back
to
our
remedies
and
discussions
but
the
3
years
havemade
it
difficult
.

I
do
n't
know
if
there
isanything
I
can
do
but
I
'm
always
willin
g
to
help
.

Good
luck
,

Mike

Th
e
Dow
topp
ed
out
in
February
of
1
966
at
995.

By
S
eptember
of
thatyear
the
Dow
had
tumbled
to
744
.

The
Dow
then
rallied
to
a
high
of
943
in
Septemberof
'
67
.

By
March
of
'68
the
Dow
had
fallento
825
,
only
to
climbto
a
h
ighl
y
speculative
peak
of
985
in
December
of

By
Aprilof
'71
the
Dow
had
climbed
back
to950
,
only
to
fall
to
869
in
February
of
'
72
.

A
big
rally
then
took
the
Dow
(
unconfirmed
)
to
a
recordhigh
of
105
1
in
Jan
uary
of
'73
,
turning
everyone
bullish
.

Butby
December
of
'
73
the
Do
w
had
collapsed
to
788
.

Think
that
was
bad
-
by
December
of
'
74
the
Dow
had
sunk
to
a
bear
market
low
of
577
.

At
that

,
thegurus
and
geniuses
of
Wall
Street
were
predic

And
that

In

Finally

In

why
are
there
two

i
d
?

i
doi
ng
a
research
paper
on
donatello
andi
notice
that
thereare
twostatues
of
David
,
abronze
one
and
marble
one
.

Mic
helangelo
made
the
marble
one
but
why
did
he
do
anoth
er
if
Donatellohad
already
made
one
?

so
im
a
little
confused
,
why
is
there
two
statues
of
David
?

differentgenerations
,
the
donatello
is
ofa
boy
david
as
a
youn
g
sheep
Herder
,
theMichelangelo
is
the
grown
up
man
david
as
slay
er
an
d
king

Because
h
e
liked
making
statues
of
David
!
:D

Obvio
usly
,
heshould
hav
e
been
arre
sted
and
jailed
-
imagine
making
a
statue
or
pa
inting
onthe
sa

subjectas
anotherartist
-
clearly
insulting
and
disrespect
ing
-
wasted

Name
o
f
specific
Hibachirestaurant
in
Chica
go
?

I
ha
v
e
a
friend
out
in
Chicago
this
week
,
and
I
am
trying
to
remember
the
name
of
an
awesome
hibachi
stylerestaurant
i
visited
whi
le
outthere
a
couple
yearsago
.

I
think
it
was
in
the
Linco
ln
Square
a
rea
bu
t
do
n't
quote
me
on
that
.

It
's
'
gimmick
'
was
thatyou
fill
your
bowl
cafeteria
-
stylefrom
raw
ingredients
and
l
eave
it
on
t
he
counter
witha
chop
st
ick
listing
y
our
table
number
on
it
.

Four
guys
around
a
largesquare
openhibachi
cook
your
fo
od
,
and
when
it'
sfinished
a
server
brings
it
to
your
table
.

A
ll
-y
ou
can
-
eat
style
deal
.

It
was
prettyepic
as
I
r
emember
and
would
love
to
send
my
friend
the
re.

Any
help
?

That

What
's
the
best
time
tostart
a
trip
around
the
worl
d
?

Well
,I
'm
about
to
graduate
in
l
ess
thena
yea
r,
and
I
'm
pl
anning
to
study
medical
school
.

But
since
in
my
country
it
lasts
for
mini
mum
6
years
,
and
I
want
to
go
aground
the
world
,
what
doyou
think,should
I
do
it
before
or
after
medical
school
?

If
you
can
af
ford
to
go
before
,
then
by
all
means
,
GO
.

If
you
have
to
wait,
due
to
financialreasons
,
then
wait
.

I
would
much
rather
put
it
off
untilI
can
afford
to
have
the
vacation
of
a
lifetime
as
I
'm
sure
thistrip
is
intendedto
be
.

Airfare
alone
will
be
incredibly
e
xpens
ive
so
make
sure
yo
u
have
th
e
money
and
ofcourse
free
time
to
take
yourtime
and
have
a
greattime

Your

,
you
got
warranty
,
let

deal
with
it
.

I
would
agree

I
also

get
in

with
Canon
.

It

the

just

what

I
've
give

decide
d
to

The

really
seem

enjoy
what
they
ar
e
doingand

It

late
in

and
I
was
worried
Iwould
get

They
picked
